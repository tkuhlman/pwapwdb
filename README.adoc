This project's name says it all, if you can say it all.
pwapwdb: Progressive Web App password Database

It is a simple (https://web.dev/progressive-web-apps/)[progressive web app] mostly written as a webassembly application with Rust.
Being a PWA means it is a simple web page installable on a wide range of devices for offline usage.
It doesn't do much that is traditionally web activity but just decrypts a local file containing passwords and acts as standard password manager.

It implements the http://pwsafe.org/[password safe] version 3 database.

The V3 password Safe Specification can be found at https://github.com/pwsafe/pwsafe/blob/master/docs/formatV3.txt
